<em>
I'm a Filipino software developer with a particular penchant for frontend web development,
specializing in architecture design for the cloud, containers, and serverless technologies. Based in Singapore.
</em>

I'm currently a <strong>Prototyping Architect</strong> for <a href='https://aws.amazon.com' rel='noreferrer noopener' target='_blank'>Amazon Web Services (AWS)</a> in ASEAN. Over the past 15 years, I've led software development projects for enterprises, startups, and government agencies in Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Canada, the USA, and the Philippines.

I really enjoy speaking for conferences, community meetups, universities, and workshops.

When I'm not [building or studying something new][1], I'm most probably either [doing hobbyist photography][2], [playing tabletop or video games][3], or picking apart a movie or TV show.

## Let's be friends.

Hit me up on my [LinkedIn][4] or on [Twitter][5] if you've got an inquiry, a hankering for a chat, or just wanna say hello.

If you're around in Singapore or the Philippines, I'm pretty much always game for a good coffee or bubble tea.
